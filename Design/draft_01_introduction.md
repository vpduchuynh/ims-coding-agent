# Comprehensive Design Document: Proficiency Testing CLI (PT-CLI)

## 1. Introduction

This document provides a detailed design specification for the Proficiency Testing Command Line Interface (PT-CLI) application. The development of this application is undertaken in response to the request outlined in the communication dated June 5, 2025, and is strictly based on the requirements defined in the Software Requirements Specification (SRS) Version 1.0 (ID: srs_proficiency_testing_cli), also dated June 5, 2025.

### 1.1 Purpose

The primary purpose of this design document is to translate the functional and non-functional requirements specified in the SRS into a concrete technical blueprint for the PT-CLI. It aims to provide developers with a clear and unambiguous guide for the implementation phase. This document details the system architecture, module-level designs for both the Python application layer and the Rust calculation engine, the command-line interface structure, data handling procedures, reporting system integration, error handling strategies, deployment plans, and a comprehensive testing strategy. Adherence to this design will ensure the final product meets all stipulated requirements, particularly alignment with ISO 13528:2022 guidelines for proficiency testing data analysis.

### 1.2 Scope

The scope of the PT-CLI, as defined by the SRS and reflected in this design, encompasses the development of a command-line tool capable of performing statistical analysis on proficiency testing data. Key functionalities include importing participant data from CSV or Excel files, validating this data, applying user-defined configurations, calculating assigned values (`x_pt`) and their standard uncertainties (`u(x_pt)`) using various methods specified in ISO 13528:2022 (including Algorithm A, CRM-based, formulation-based, and expert consensus methods), calculating participant performance scores (z-scores and z'-scores), and generating comprehensive reports in multiple formats (PDF, HTML, Word) via integration with the external Quarto CLI tool. The system architecture employs Python for the main application logic, CLI, and workflow orchestration, leveraging Rust via PyO3 for computationally intensive statistical calculations to ensure performance. This design explicitly excludes the development of a graphical user interface (GUI).

### 1.3 Definitions, Acronyms, and Abbreviations
