### 1. Introduction

#### 1.1 Purpose

This Software Requirements Specification (SRS) document describes the functional and non-functional requirements for the Proficiency Testing Command Line Interface (PT-CLI) application. The PT-CLI is designed for proficiency testing providers to estimate assigned values for proficiency test items in alignment with the ISO 13528:2022 guidelines. It will utilize Python for the main application logic and user interface, and Rust for computationally intensive statistical calculations, with Quarto for report generation.

#### 1.2 Scope

The PT-CLI will provide functionalities for:

- Importing participant proficiency testing data.
    
- Calculating assigned values (`x_pt`) using methods specified in ISO 13528:2022, including robust statistical methods like Algorithm A.
    
- Calculating the standard uncertainty of the assigned value (`u(x_pt)`).
    
- Calculating participant performance scores (e.g., z-scores, z'-scores).
    
- Generating comprehensive reports in various formats (PDF, HTML, Word) using Quarto.
    
- Allowing user configuration for calculation parameters and reporting options.
    

The application is intended to be used as a command-line tool. It will not include a graphical user interface (GUI).

### 2. Overall Description

#### 2.1 Product Perspective

The PT-CLI is a standalone desktop application intended to be run from a command line environment. It leverages a hybrid architecture, with a Python front-end for user interaction and workflow management, and a Rust back-end for performance-critical calculations. Quarto is used as an external tool for report generation. The PT-CLI will be installable as a Python package, which includes the compiled Rust extension.

#### 2.2 Product Functions

The primary functions of the PT-CLI are:

1. **Data Import:** Allow users to import proficiency testing data from standard file formats (CSV, Excel).
    
2. **Data Validation:** Perform validation on input data to ensure correctness and completeness.
    
3. **Configuration:** Allow users to configure calculation parameters and reporting options via configuration files.
    
4. **Statistical Calculation:** Perform robust statistical calculations as per ISO 13528:2022 to determine assigned values and their uncertainties. This includes:
    
    - Consensus value from participant results (e.g., Algorithm A).
        
    - Calculation based on CRM values.
        
    - Calculation based on formulation.
        
    - Calculation based on expert laboratory consensus.
        
5. **Performance Scoring:** Calculate participant performance scores (z-scores, z'-scores).
    
6. **Report Generation:** Generate comprehensive, publication-quality reports in multiple formats (PDF, HTML, Word) using Quarto.
    
7. **CLI Operation:** Provide a user-friendly command-line interface for all operations.
    

#### 2.3 User Characteristics

The primary users of the PT-CLI are expected to be:

- Proficiency testing providers.
    
- Statisticians or technical staff involved in PT scheme design and data analysis.
    
- Users comfortable with command-line interfaces.
    
- Users with a working knowledge of ISO 13528 concepts.
    

#### 2.4 Constraints

- **Operating System:** The system should be primarily developed and tested for common desktop operating systems (Windows, macOS, Linux).
    
- **Programming Languages:** The core application logic will be in Python. Performance-critical calculations will be implemented in Rust.

    - Python libraries: Typer, Pandas, Pydantic, PyYAML/TOML, Rich, Matplotlib/Seaborn, subprocess.
        
    - Rust crates: PyO3, statrs, ndarray, ndarray-stats, serde.
        
- **No GUI:** The application will be CLI-only.
    
- **Performance:** Rust components are chosen for performance in calculations. Overall performance should be acceptable for typical PT data set sizes.

    - For CRM-based values, `u(x_pt)` should be derived from the uncertainty stated on the CRM certificate.
        
    - For formulation-based values, `u(x_pt)` should be estimated based on the uncertainties of the formulation process.
